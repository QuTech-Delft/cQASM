The goal of these files is to provide user-friendly tools to extract metrics for quantum circuits.

Initial goals:
- Length of longest repeating subcircuit
- Number of occurrences of the above longest repeating subcircuit
- Length of critical path
- Number of critical paths
- Statistical distribution of paths from source to target in dependency graph (between gates): mean length, median, etc.
